### EDA

Running Exploratory data analysis in various open-source datasets.Then also visualize those datasets for better understanding. In some cases, python and machine learning and in some cases advance algorithm likes AUC(ROC) or Linear or Logistics regression.

### Natural Language Processing:

I have also done some NLP using python for sentiment analysis.

### Web Scraping project:

For collecting raw data from the internet web scraping is needed. I have done some scraping on Twitter, Scopus, or some other website to scrape raw data. Often for scraping raw data we need special requirements and special API keys. As a researcher, the API key has certain limitations too.
