Hi!

I am Khandoker Tanjim Ahammad, is a student of Microelectronics and Microsystem in TU-Hamburg. I completed My bachelor's from Americal International University Bangladesh in 2016 from the Electronics department. In 2017 I moved to Hamburg, Germany where I started my master's in Microelectronics. In 2019, I finished my internship in Euler Hermes Rating GmbH which is a part of Allianz. where I worked in Data Science Research & Development department. In 2020 November, I joined as a Research Assistant at Leibniz Institute/HBI. Currently, I am working in Desk-net GmbH as a data researcher assistant.

## Expertise:
Data Analysis: Python, R, Bash, SQL, Power BI, STATA, C++, Git, Git-version control, CLI
Machine learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, Deep Learning, Open Cv
Dashboard: Streamlit and Plotly


## Interest: 

Over the year I gain lots of experience by working with some brilliant minds. 
I am intereted in the following topics:
- Computer vision
